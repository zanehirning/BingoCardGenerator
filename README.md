# BingoCardGenerator
This is a simple Bingo Card Generator that will generate bingo cards (up to 16 spaces) depending on the user's input. It will not contain any repeating numbers. The output will be placed into a file with the title of the user's choosing. This way bingo cards can be generated and printed for the user's personal use.
All code can be found on the "master" branch.
