This UML diagram is very easy to follow and very well written. It includes all the files that it was supposed to contain. However, I was unsure whether or not to include Menu and MenuOption, as they are already *technically* completed files. 
This is assuming that you are making no changes to these files, otherwise, you are completely right in adding them. I do not see any data members included in the UML (variables with self, etc). It was to my understanding we were supposed to add those as well.
I would review the requirements and see if they are meant to be included. Overall, it looks good and is very straightforward to read and is understandable.

From a customer standpoint, I believe this diagram would give me a pretty good overview of what the program is designed to do. The association arrows were very helpful, and with a decent understanding of Bingo, and how the game works, this UML would help the customers view how it would work, as well as other programmers.
Every function in the program has an associating type, this was something I had forgotten to do. There is nothing I would change about this document for readability sake, but I would review the instructions and validate that you followed them correctly. I should probably do the same.
The entire UML is organized and well put together, therefore, I would say that your UML diagram was extremely helpful, and it should help you continue designing your program.

# Reviews You Received

Looking at your UML I do think you have all of the class names correct other than you should take off the .py and you even remembered to italicize UserInterface. You are also missing class menu and menu options. I believe these were written for you but they said in class that you must also include them in the UML. I also notice with the format with your class boxes they need to be 3 boxes, the top box has the class name, the second has the variable names, and the last one has the methods. Your arrows I believe should be pointing the other way. The arrow should be pointing to what called/created them. I do notice you used one description “stored in” but you should probably add more. There are also different meanings between solid and dotted lines for the arrows that we went over in class. So, you should make sure that you are using the correct ones.
    Your variable section/__init__ section should only have the variables and their type such as “nSize : int”; you do not need any description for the variables. For the methods section, all the methods should be in one box and usually shouldn’t be more than one line. You just need to declare the method name, include its parameters, and then add what return type. The output should look like “-get_str(prompt) : str”. You do not need to describe what the method does. Some methods are also missing a “+” or ”-” like shuffle.
